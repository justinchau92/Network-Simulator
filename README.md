# Network-Simulator

##Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a basic Send-And-Wait protocol simulator. The protocol will be half-duplex and use sliding windows to send multiple packets between to hosts on a LAN with an “unreliable network” between the two hosts. The following diagram depicts the model:
